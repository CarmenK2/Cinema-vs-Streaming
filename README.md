# Cinema-vs-Streaming Services - Project2

## Overview:
Back in the day if people wanted to watch the latest movie everyone else was talking about, they go to the cinema with their family or friends. In case they did not make it on the movie schedule, they had to wait for it to be available in their nearest video rental shop.

Nowadays due to technological advancement we have the option to use streaming services in the comfort of our own homes to watch movies. This option gained more popularity when Covid happened as most people chose to stay home and also restrictions were put in place on public spaces. This made us ask the question, are cinemas still relevant?

## Conclusion
It seems that the streaming services did not have much effect on people's preference on going to movies. Data shows that cinemas available and movie-goers have been steady until Covid happened. The pandemic is the main factor that affected the number of cinemas being open and people attending due to the protocols and restrictions put in place by the government.

With the easing of restrictions, the numbers have gone up compared to 2020 however due to the uncertainty we have with further effects of Covid, we cannot confirm if it would continuously go up the same level as pre-Covid.
